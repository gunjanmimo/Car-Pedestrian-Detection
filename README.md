# Car-Pedestrian-Detection

This is a AI based car and pedestrian detection for road safety using OpenCV

## Main steps

1. collecting image data of cars and pedestrians
2. convert images into greyscale to make the model faster and color is not important to detect object in this project
3. train algorithm to detect cars and pedestrains

## How the algorithm works behind?

Using the Haar featue computer calculate the correlation bewteen pixels of the model and the object



# Requirement 
```
pip install opencv-python
```
